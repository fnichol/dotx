# Override default terminal program choice

# Note that we are not using `$i3-wm.binding.terminal` because that keybinding
# has already been registered in the main config file. In
# `~/.config/regolith/Xresources` we override the value for
# `$i3-wm.binding.terminal` to free up its default value `Return`, so we can
# use it later, here. It's sneaky but unless and until there is an upstream
# `$i3-vm.program.launcher.app` variable, then this will work as a work around.
